# Groundhog
This project aims to extract some relevant information from the data received in real-time on standard input (each
float representing a temperature), in order to detect weather aberrations (droughts, severe colds, hurricanes
or any other extreme climatic condition whatsoever) as soon as possible. (PDF available)

### Usage:
      make re &&
      ./groundhog -h
